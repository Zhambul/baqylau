# The web dashboard (`dashboard/` + `bin/claude-dashboard.py`)

A localhost web UI over the whole session estate: every session (live and
parked) with its mirror stream, scoreboard stats, agents, costs and errors —
plus the two things a terminal pane can't give you: **drill-down into any
agent's full activity timeline** and **toast/OS notifications across all
sessions** when a session starts asking you something or finishes its turn.

It is a CONSUMER, not a producer: everything it shows comes through
`core/sessionapi.py` (the one read-side door — [sessionapi.md](sessionapi.md))
and `plugins.activity()`. It writes no session state; its only writes are its
own singleton pid-lock and audit rows.

```
bin/claude-dashboard.py     the CLI: serve | start | stop | status | open
dashboard/server.py         HTTP + SSE + the notification watcher
dashboard/opshtml.py        paint ops -> HTML (the web presenter)
dashboard/static/           the single-page app (vanilla JS/CSS, no build step)
```

`./bin/claude-dashboard.py` (default verb `open`) starts the server if needed
and opens `http://127.0.0.1:8377` (`CLAUDE_DASH_PORT` overrides).

## Placement: a fourth dependency tier

`dashboard/` sits ABOVE core/plugins/frontends: it imports `core/` and the
`plugins` registry root (for `activity()`), and nothing imports it back except
its bin/ entry and the tests. It cannot live in `plugins/` — plugins never
import each other, and the dashboard needs the cross-plugin registry — and it
isn't a `frontends/` terminal either (the Frontend interface is about pane
control; the dashboard has no panes). The precedent is the bin/ renderers,
which already sit at this height; `dashboard/` is that tier made importable so
the server is testable in-process.

## Server design (each choice rejects a specific trap)

Decisions inherited from the sessionapi design review (docs/sessionapi.md's
"web dashboard notes", now implemented):

- **Read-only, 127.0.0.1 only.** The page shows raw command output and
  transcripts; it must never sit on a routable interface. There is no write
  endpoint at all — the ⧉ copy endpoint *returns* text; the browser owns its
  clipboard.
- **`ThreadingHTTPServer` + per-request fresh `mode=ro` reads** — NOT the OTLP
  receiver's single-threaded request loop: sqlite connections are
  thread-affine, and concurrent SSE streams need concurrent handlers. No
  connection is shared across requests; every read goes through the API's
  `*_at()`/fresh-conn paths. In particular ops are read via `ops_at()` on the
  RESOLVED DB path (live or parked) — never `ops_after()`, whose live-path
  `connect()` would CREATE the DB and fake the session-alive signal for a
  parked session. (Same reason the click-to-view endpoint reads through
  `kv_at()`, the read-only twin added for it.)
- **Singleton + explicit lifecycle** — a `core/locks.py` pid-lock on
  `paths.DASH_DB` with the port bind as the second guard; started/stopped
  explicitly by the CLI. Deliberately NOT the OTLP receiver's 900s idle-exit +
  respawn-on-SessionStart: that lifecycle is correct for a receiver that only
  matters while sessions emit metrics, and wrong for a dashboard that must be
  up precisely when you're browsing PARKED sessions at midnight.
- **gzip in one place.** `_send` — the single non-SSE response path — gzips its
  body (`Content-Encoding: gzip`, recomputed `Content-Length`, `Vary:
  Accept-Encoding`) when the client offers gzip and the body clears `GZIP_MIN`
  (~1KB); everything routed through it is text (JSON/HTML/CSS/JS/plain). SSE is
  never compressed — it holds the response open and writes incremental frames
  through its own `_sse_*` writers, so buffering it through gzip would break the
  stream.
- **Audit shape**: `start` spawns `serve` through `core/spawn.spawn_detached`
  (the `A.spawn` row), and `serve()` runs inside `core.tail.stream_lifecycle`
  (kind `dashboard`) — the server's lifetime is a `streams` row whose
  `end_reason` says how it exited (`stopped` / `port-busy` / lock-denied
  errors ride `A.error`; a crash closes the row as `crash` with a traceback in
  `errors`). Request-handler failures audit once per request via `A.error`
  with the path.

## The web presenter (`opshtml.py`)

The third presenter over vocabularies owned elsewhere (the parse/paint
precedent): `core/ops.py` owns the op shapes; `claude-mirror.py` paints them
to ANSI at pane width; `opshtml.py` renders them to HTML. Width-dependent
layout deliberately does NOT port — wrapping, gutter repetition, rule length
and chip truncation are CSS facts in a browser (`pre-wrap`, `border-left`,
block elements, `text-overflow`), so each op maps to a structured block and
`codefmt.render` runs at an effectively-unwrapped width (`CODE_W`).

**Security — the `neutralize()` analog.** Op text is raw command output
(attacker-adjacent bytes; the `@kitty-cmd` replay incident is the terminal
form of this bug class). Every character is `html.escape`d inside
`ansi_html()`; input first passes `render.neutralize()` so only the two
sanctioned survivors — SGR styling and OSC 8 hyperlinks — are ever
*interpreted*, exactly mirroring the terminal renderer. SGR runs become
inline-styled `<span>`s (truecolor verbatim; 256/16-color mapped); a
`claude-copy:///<key>/<gid>/<what>` OSC 8 link becomes
`<a class="cc" data-cc=…>` which the app intercepts — copy verbs call
`/api/session/<sid>/copy/<gid>/<what>` (served by the SAME `core/copy.collect`
the terminal click handler uses — one owner of "what does ⧉cmd copy") and put
the result on the clipboard; the `view` verb fetches the rendered
`view:<gid>` stash from `/view/<gid>` and toggles it inline, the web twin of
click-to-view. Any other URL becomes a plain `target=_blank` anchor.

**Markdown for conversation text** (`opshtml.md_html`). Assistant messages,
user prompts and teammate mail are markdown in practice, so the dashboard
renders them as markdown instead of a flat `<pre>` — a small dependency-free
subset (headings, bold/italic, inline & fenced code, un/ordered lists,
blockquotes, `http(s)` links, rules, paragraphs). Two rules dictate the shape.
The **no-build/no-deps rule** rules out a markdown library, so it is hand-rolled
(~150 lines). The **escape rule** (the `neutralize()` analog) rules out any
"escape later" design: block *structure* is detected on the raw lines (the
sigils `#-*>`` ``[]()` are ASCII and emit nothing themselves), but every
fragment that reaches the page is `html.escape`d at its leaf — `_md_inline`
escapes before layering emphasis, and a fenced block is highlighted through the
single lexer owner (`render.lexer` via `coderender.render_code`) to ANSI and
then `ansi_html` (which escapes), falling back to plain escaped text when
pygments/the lexer is absent. So `<script>` survives as escaped text in every
context, and a `javascript:` link renders as literal text (only `http(s)` URLs
become anchors). Malformed markdown never raises — the outer guard returns
escaped plain text. The timeline endpoints (`/activity`, `/agent`) add an
`html` field to message/prompt/teammsg entries *additively* (the raw `text`
stays), and `app.js` uses it via `innerHTML` (server-escaped by construction),
falling back to `pre(text)` when absent.

**Why not an xterm.js embed** (the Hermes harness does one): the mirror's
content is not a pty — it's a structured op stream that reflows. An embedded
terminal would need a server-side repaint-to-ANSI at the browser's column
width on every resize (re-implementing claude-mirror.py per client), and adds
the project's first frontend build dependency. Structured HTML + CSS gets
reflow for free and keeps the no-build rule.

## Endpoints

| Route | Returns |
|---|---|
| `/` `/static/<name>` | the app (whitelist — no path resolution on user input) |
| `/api/sessions` | discovery list + per-row stats + tab state |
| `/api/session/<sid>` | overview: `session()` + error count |
| `/api/session/<sid>/ops?after=N` | `{last, html: […]}` server-rendered ops |
| `/api/session/<sid>/activity` | main-thread timeline (`plugins.activity(sid)`) |
| `/api/session/<sid>/agent/<aid>` | one agent's timeline |
| `/api/session/<sid>/errors` | swallowed-exception rows |
| `/api/session/<sid>/view/<gid>` | rendered click-to-view stash (HTML) |
| `/api/session/<sid>/copy/<gid>/<what>` | copy text (`core/copy.collect`) |
| `/events` | global SSE: `sessions` snapshots on change + `notify` toasts |
| `/events/session/<sid>?after=N&mpos=M` | per-session SSE: `ops`/`msgs`/`stats`/`agents`/`costs`/`tab`, each on change; a fresh connection's first `ops` event is the anchor-merged backlog (see below) |

SSE is plain polling server-side (`TICK_S` per session, `GLOBAL_TICK_S`
global) pushed over a held response — no websockets dependency, and
`EventSource` gives the client reconnect for free (the app reconnects with
`?after=<last seen op id>` so nothing repeats).

## Grouping and titles

The sessions view groups by DIRECTORY (cwd — the audit `sessions` row),
groups ordered by their newest session; the directory name lives on the group
header, so the card itself is titled by the SESSION's name. That name comes
from `plugins.session_title(transcript_path)` — a path-keyed fan-out (the
list view already holds every row's path; 50 sid-keyed `session_row()`
resolutions per poll would be waste). The claude_code provider
(`transcript.session_title`) returns the last `summary` record in the head
window (Claude Code prepends them on resume) or, when none exists — this
setup stores no summaries; `conversation_summaries` in `__store.db` is empty —
the first line of the first REAL user prompt, which is effectively what the
`claude --resume` picker shows (`history.jsonl` `display`). `isMeta` rows and
`<command-*>`/`<local-command-*>` wrappers are plumbing, never titles. The
server caches titles by `(path, size)` — a title can only change when the
transcript grows. Agent cards follow the same rule: the Task description
(`desc` from the state DB's agents table) IS the agent's name; the raw
`agent_id` drops to the subtitle.

## The conversation in the web stream

The terminal mirror deliberately omits the main agent's messages — the main
pane already shows them. The web has no main pane, so the dashboard
interleaves the main-thread conversation (prompts / assistant messages /
teammate mail) into the session stream — web-side only; no producer or
terminal-renderer change.

**Interleaving by timestamp, anchors as the fallback.** The ops table carries
a `ts REAL` column (`core/state.py`, one wall-clock stamp per `ops_append`
batch — additive migration, so older parked `*.keep` DBs keep working and their
pre-migration rows read back `_ts` None), and `ops_after`/`ops_at` inject that
value into each op dict under the reserved `_ts` key (the mirror renderer reads
ops via `.get` and ignores it). `transcript.conversation(path, pos)` likewise
stamps each record with `ts` — the transcript line's ISO `timestamp` as an
epoch float, None when absent. When BOTH sides have a timestamp,
`merged_backlog()` interleaves chronologically: each message lands after the
last op that precedes it in time. This is why ops needed a real time column —
the earlier anchor-only scheme could not order a message *between* two ops of
the same tool block.

`anchor` (the last tool_use id seen before a record; ops carry the matching
`g`/`v`) survives as the FALLBACK for pre-migration history — an op or record
without a timestamp is placed after its anchor's LAST op. Pre-first-tool
messages (anchor None, no ts) lead the stream; messages whose anchor never
painted an op keep their relative order at the tail. This works for ALL
history, parked sessions included. Live updates need neither key: the
per-session SSE tails the transcript by byte cursor (`mpos`, resumed across
reconnects like the ops `after` cursor) and appends `msgs` events in arrival
order — interleave is a backfill affordance, not a live-ordering guarantee.
`/api/session/<sid>/ops` stays PURE ops (the mirror-parity endpoint); the merge
exists only in the SSE backlog.

## Notifications (the toaster)

One daemon thread diffs the ENTIRE tab table (`sessionapi.tab_states()` — the
whole-table reader added for exactly this; per-window probes would be N
queries for one snapshot) once a second, and maps windows to sessions via the
audit `sessions` rows' `kitty_window_id` (newest session wins the window — a
kitty window outlives sessions). A transition INTO `awaiting-command` (red —
Claude is asking you) or `awaiting-response` (green — done, your turn) pushes
a `notify` event to every `/events` client; the app shows an in-page toast
always and an OS `Notification` when the page is hidden. The first scan is a
baseline, never news. Windowless sessions (headless/daemon) produce no
toasts, same as they have no tab colour — that's the tab system's own
scoping, not a dashboard limitation.

## The husk rows (hidden agents)

`agents()` returns some rows with EVERY field empty (no kind/desc/slot/
transcript/start): bookkeeping left by the subagent finaliser's
`never started (hidden agent)` path — a `SubagentStop` for one of Claude
Code's hidden auxiliary agents, which fires no `SubagentStart` and streams no
transcript (the same population the OTEL pipeline exists to price). Zero
user-facing signal, so the server's `visible_agents()` filters them out of
the dashboard's payloads — presentation policy; the API itself keeps
reporting them (they're real state, and the audit `hook_events` decision
string is the provenance). A row with at least one real field always shows;
one that's merely thin (desc but no transcript yet) renders dim and stays
clickable — the layout-derivation fallback in `plugins.activity` sometimes
finds a transcript the audit never saw.

## Codex runs in the agents list

A session's codex runs ride the same agents list and drill-down, with no
dashboard-side special-casing: `sessionapi.agents()` merges the audit
`streams` rows of `kind='codex'` in the same row shape (kind `codex`, `desc`
= the run label, `agent_id` = `sessionapi.codex_aid()` — synthesized from the
stream's src_path basename, since codex tailers record no hook agent_id), and
`/api/session/<sid>/agent/<aid>` reaches the codex `plugins.activity()`
provider (`plugins/codex/rollout.timeline` — the same timeline dict shape as
the claude one, see [sessionapi.md](sessionapi.md)). A companion job's `.log`
run shows a card but has no parseable rollout — its drill-down renders the
"no recorded activity" empty state, same as a transcript-less husk.

## Design language

Hermes-harness-inspired (Nous Research's Hermes Agent dashboard): the whole
theme derives from a 3-color palette via CSS `color-mix()` — near-black
canvas, one midground accent tinting text/borders/hovers alike — plus a warm
radial glow vignette and a film-grain noise overlay; borders are 1px INSET
accent-tinted hairlines (box-shadow), never drop shadows. Retuning the theme
is editing `--bg`/`--mid`/`--warm-glow` in `style.css`. Status and semantic
hues are NOT part of the derivation — they stay the terminal system's own
(`core/tabs.py` COLORS, `core/ops.py` semantic table) so the web and the kitty
mirror read as one system.

## Testing

`tests/test_l0_dashboard.py`: opshtml contract tests (escaping, SGR/OSC8,
copy-link specs, lex/num gut bodies), the server on an ephemeral in-process
port (never through `serve()` — no singleton lock in tests) against data
seeded via the real product APIs, and the notification watcher's transition
logic. Import safety for both modules rides `test_import_safety.py`.
